#Information Retrieval System for Health-Related Documents
This project is a basic information retrieval (IR) system designed to retrieve health-related documents based on user queries. The system applies preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming to prepare the data. Using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, the IR system ranks documents according to their relevance to predefined queries.

Key Features
a) Text Preprocessing: Includes lowercasing, tokenization, removal of stop words, and stemming to prepare the documents and queries for analysis.
b) TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts documents and queries into numerical vectors, which reflect the importance of each term.
c) Cosine Similarity for Ranking: Measures the similarity between document and query vectors, enabling the system to rank documents based on relevance.
d) Health-Focused Dataset: Includes documents on various health-related topics, such as nutrition, mental health, exercise, and disease prevention, to provide relevant information in response to user queries.
